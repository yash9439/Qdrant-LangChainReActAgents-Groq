# Qdrant-LangChainReActAgents-Groq

Code implementation for building an intelligent information retrieval system using LangChain ReAct agents, Qdrant Vector Database, and the llama3 large language model (LLM) from the Groq Inference endpoint.

## Introduction

This project demonstrates how to combine the power of LangChain's ReAct agents, Qdrant's efficient vector storage and retrieval capabilities, and the lightning-fast inference of llama3 from Groq to create a robust and intelligent information retrieval system.

## Key Features

- **Data Extraction and Processing:** Extracts text from PDF documents and prepares it for storage in Qdrant.
- **Qdrant Vector Database Integration:** Utilizes Qdrant to store and retrieve text chunks as high-dimensional vectors using custom embeddings.
- **LangChain ReAct Agents:** Employs ReAct agents to orchestrate complex query handling, breaking down queries into manageable steps.
- **llama3 LLM from Groq Endpoint:** Leverages the llama3 LLM for advanced language understanding and response generation.
- **Customizable Tools and Functions:** Includes customizable tools and functions for retrieving specific information, such as age and health status.
- **Gradio UI:** Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the system.

## Getting Started
